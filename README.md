## ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION: Research has shown that Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1), initially developed for glycemic control in diabetes, may have broader implications for reducing the increased risk of depression and anxiety (Chen et al., 2024). However, current research in this area remains limited and existing literature has shown inconsistent evidence in the incidence of depression by GLP-1 use(GLP-1 Is Both Anxiogenic and Antidepressant; Divergent Effects of Acute and Chronic GLP-1 on Emotionality - ScienceDirect, n.d.; Kim et al., 2020; Pozzi et al., 2019). This study aimed to investigate the association of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1) use with anxiety and depression among adults (age ≥18 years) with diabetes. 

METHODS: We selectively analyzed cross-sectional survey data on 7,635 adults (≥18 years) with diabetes collected across multiple years (2018, 2018, 2020). Instances of anxiety, depression and diabetes, were classified based on the World Health Organization’s Ninth Revision, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) (ICD - ICD-9-CM - International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, 2023); GLP-1 defined as incretin mimetics, was determined from prescription drug files using the Multum Lexicon therapeutic sub-sub-class code 373, (MEPS H68F18 CODEBOOK, n.d.; MEPS HC-068: Multum Lexicon Addendum Files to MEPS Prescribed Medicines Files 1996-2013, n.d.). Rao-Scott Chi-square tests and multivariable binary logistic regressions that accounted for clustering, stratification, and weights were used to assess the association between GLP-1 use and anxiety/depression. 

RESULTS: Among GLP-1 users, 17.8% reported anxiety and 16.7% reported depression whereas in GLP-1 non-users 13.3% reported anxiety and 14.9% reported depression. In the regression model adjusted for GLP-1, sex, age grouped in years, race and ethnicity, SDOH (marital status, education, poverty status, employment, region, health insurance, prescription drug coverage), number of chronic conditions, body mass index, and physical activity, GLP-1 use was not significantly associated with anxiety (AOR=1.27; 95% CI 0.94,1.70 ; p=0.1135) or depression (AOR=0.98; 95% CI 0.72,1.32 ; p=0.8822).

CONCLUSION: This study found there were not statistically significations associations of GLP-1 use with either anxiety or depression among adults with diabetes. Further research employing robust designs such as prospective cohort studies, is needed to validate the findings from this cross-sectional study.
